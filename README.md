This program will merge all the test and train data together provided in the UCI HAR Dataset proivided at the following link:

The program is pretty straight foward
it load all the data files and combined them.
There is no fancy functions to do the heavy work.
I think the most complicated function i use is aggreate or a reg ex expression.
All tables could be easy read in with data.table.

The code is commented with the activity.
I hope you enjoy
